# Graph Visualization and PageRank of the Yelp Social Recommender Network

##Abstract
Yelp users traditionally interact with business listings by looking at star ratings and reading other user’s reviews. However, manually scanning through pages of ratings and reviews isn’t scalable. A city like Pittsburgh can contain over thousands of business listings and tens of thousands of reviews. I propose a network graph visualization of the Yelp social recommender network that uses PageRank relative node size to illustrate business importance and influence. To demonstrate the benefits of graph visualization, I created sample graphs using data from the Yelp Academic Dataset Round 8.
